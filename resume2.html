<h5>Title	:  Advance Search Engine.
</h5>
<p>Description: An abstract concept where we design a system that smartly works based on the amount of moisture found in the environment, that is in presence of high moisture the mortar turns off and in case of low moisture it turns on, it also has the capability of working remotely with the help of any device such as our mobile phones.

<h5>Title            : Sun tracking solar panel
</h5>
<p>Description: An abstract concept where we design a system that smartly works based on the amount of sunlight emitted by the sun, here stepper motor is used to track the sun so that the maximum light is incident upon the panel at any given time of the day.
	This is better compared to light sensing method that may not be accurate always, for example during cloudy days. So in this project solar panel is connected to the LDR where the solar panel is rotated due to transition of sun from east to west the fixed solar panel may generate optimum energy. The proposed system solves the problem by an arrangement for the solar panel to track the sun. Further the project can be enhanced by using RTC(Real Time Clock) to follow the sun. This helps in maintaining the required position of the panel even if the power is interrupted for some time.
